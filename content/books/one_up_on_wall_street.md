Loved reading it, the book outlines Lynch's investment philosophy and the strategies he used to achieve his remarkable succes as the manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund.

Lynch's approach to investing is grounded in common sense and encourages investors to think long-term and stay patient. He also emphasizes on the fact that the average retail investor has alot of natural advantages but they choose to ignore them.

A few memorable sentences that stood out to me:

>"I felt as if i understoond what Isaac Newton was talking about when he said: If i have seen further... it is by standing upon the shoulders of Giants"

>"The secret of his success is that he never went to business school- imagine all the lessons he never had to unlearn."

>"To me, an investment is simply a gamble in which you've managed to tilt the odds in your favor."

>"When in doubt, tune in later."


To summarize: Great book gives a lot of examples and really tries to teach you something would recommend reading it.

**SCORE: 8/10**
