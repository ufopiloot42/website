## Achieving real happiness, changing your life? Is it even possible?

After reading this book and pondering about the concepts and ideas told... it makes me want to believe in the profound visions of Alfred Adler (one of the three giants of the twentieth-century psychology algonside Freud and Jung). Although it will probably take a lifetime to master these concepts -everything worthwhile in life takes time, and so does the level of gratitude you ultimately develop upon its eventual fulfillment.

The book employs an exchange between a seasoned philosopher and a troubled young individual.

The essence of the book in short is: You can change any time but you choose not to because you lack courage. You are unable to change because you make the decision not to. What is the solution? **Have courage.**

While I believe the book's message is best conveyed through reading it yourself, like always i will share a few quotes/sentences from this book that truly resonated with me:

>"We can't go back to the past in a time machine. We can't turn back the hands of time. If you end up staying in aetiology, you will be bound by the past and never be able to find hapiness."

>But those who make themselves look bigger on borrowed power are essentialy living according to other people's value systems-they are living other people's lives.

>"The important thing is not what you are born with, but what use one makes of that equipment."

>We cannot alter objective facts. But subjective interpretations can be altered as much as one likes. And we are inhabitants of a subjective world.

>Relationships in which people restrict each other eventually fall apart.

>Wishing so hard to be recognised will lead to a life of following expectations held by other people who want you to be 'this kind of person'.

>The courage to be happy includes the courage to be disliked.

>You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink -he is the one who has to face his tasks.

>"Someone has to start. Other people might not be cooperative, but that is not connected to you. My advice is this: you should start. With no regard to whether other are cooperative or not."

>"God grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change, courage to change the things i can, and wisdom always to tell the difference." -Kurt Vonnegut

>People can only be truly aware of their worth when they are able to feel 'I am of use to someone' -hapiness is the feeling of contribution.

>Since neither the past nor the future exist, let's talk about now. It's not yesterday of tomorrow that decides it. It's here and now.

>If i change, the world will change. No one else will change the world for me.


To summarize:

I truly enjoyed reading this book, cherishing its ideas and concepts for life. However when reading this book please allow some time to really think over some of the concepts don't just read it for the whole purpose of finishing the book. You must really think and ponder about it and ask questions. - It is for that reason i would recommend this book to anyone struggling with self-doubt or a sense of being lost.
**Give it a read.**

**SCORE: 8.5/10**
