How to lie with statistics is a book on the tricks and techniques used to manipulate statistics and mislead people.

It highlights common errors in statistical analysis and encourages readers to approach statistics with a healthy dose of skepticism.

It also provides numerous examples of how statistics can be misused, such as through selective use of data, exaggeration, and distortion of graphs and charts.

If you like statistics, then you should read this book! Even though it's not really my area of expertise, I still found it interesting in parts. The book was written in 1954, so it has aged quite a bit, but the lessons it teaches are still valid.

To summarize: It's a good book for people who enjoy statistics, but it didn't really appeal to me.

**SCORE: 6/10**
