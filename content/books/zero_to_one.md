A book written by Peter Thiel an entrepeneur/venture capitalist mostly known for his early investments in facebook and being one of the co-founders of paypal. The book shows the perspective Thiel has on early startups, technology and how to innovate.

### Going from "zero to one"

To go from nothing to something represents the creation of something that has never existed before.
Thiel emphasizes the importance of developing monopoly-like businesses that offer unique value propositions, as opposed to competing in crowded markets.

The biggest leaps in progress are vertical not horizontal. Most of the progress we see day-to-day is horizontal. Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create something new we go from 0 to 1. The act of creation is singular.

If you take one typewriter and build 100, you have made **horizontal progress**. If you have a typewriter and build a word processor, you have made **vertical progress**.






### Like always i will share a few quotes/sentences from this book that i enjoyed:


>Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius.

>1. It is better to risk boldness that triviality.
>2. A bad plan is better than no plan.
>3. Competitive markets destroy profits.
>4. Sales matters just as much as products.

>The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.

>In business, money is either an important thing or it is everything.

>According to Marx, people fight because they are different. -The greater the differences, the greater the conflict.

>Winning is better than losing but everybody loses when the war isn't one worth fighting.

>The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors.

>As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don't disrupt: avoid competition as much as possible.

>You should focus relentlessly on something you're good at doing, but before that you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future.

>Defining roles reduced conflicts.

>Seven questions every business must answer:
>1. Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
>2. Is now the right time to start your particular business?
>3. Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
>4. Do you have the right team?
>5. Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?
>6. Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?
>7. Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see?


To summarize:

Great book to read, doesn't take that long to read and the ideas are refreshing. Thiel's visions are unique and sometimes contrarian which is what made me enjoy the book.


**SCORE: 7/10**
