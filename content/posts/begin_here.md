The way i see things is the following: you have **two options** with almost everything you do in life.

### You take the blue pill the story ends you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.
>Remain in the blissful ignorance of illusion.

The option tied to this mindset is called **index investing**, index investing requires a minimum level of knowledge and **will** outperform most actively managed counterparts. 

Index funds are designed **to keep pace** with market returns because they try to mirror certain market segments.

Active funds **try to beat** market returns with investments that are hand-picked by *professional money managers.*

### You take the red pill you stay in wonderland and i show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.
>Embrace the sometimes painful truth of reality.

While index investing takes a more passive approach, active investing tries to take matters into their own hands by cherry picking each stock indiviually.

Altough like mentioned above in terms of blue or red or for that matter black and white each strategy has its own unique reasons for doing so.

However each method  can complement the other when combined in a diversified and balanced portfolio.

Thats why when looking at investing most people see it as described as above either blue or red.

We all naturally strive to reduce uncomfortable thoughts and emotions that sit poorly with our dearly held beliefs. But this is a vital mistake in the finance sector -the moment you get emotionally attached to a vision im afraid you've already lost.

That's why i've created this website, to help guide you to the point you will be able to take care of it yourself:
